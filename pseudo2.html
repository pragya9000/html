    <p>"Roses Are Red" is the name of a love poem and children's rhyme with Roud Folk Song Index number 19798. It has become a clich√© for Valentine's Day, and has spawned multiple humorous and parodic variants. A modern standard version is: Roses are red Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet And so are you.</p>
